**Motivation:**

Embarking on this project marks my entry into the dynamic world of data-driven decision-making. This opportunity allows me to apply theories and techniques to real-world scenarios, transforming abstract concepts into tangible outcomes. I navigated data complexities, using analytical tools to ask insightful questions and uncover meaningful answers. This project enhanced my critical thinking, creative problem-solving, teamwork, and communication skills. The insights and abilities developed here are foundational to my journey in the ever-evolving field of data analytics.
